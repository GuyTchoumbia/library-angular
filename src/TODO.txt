API	
* integration/modification of API
 - entites: 
		* create roles and filters: 
			-> web request doesnt contain user property of documents, but only isBorrowed property.
			-> each user can have access, and only access to its own documents (borrowed list);
		* create quantity property, linked to user/document.
			Each document is unique, albeit has a unique "CÃ´te" property, but each library can have multiple copies of the same document, 
			meaning a search of one document will find the multiple copies (or "cotes") across libraries.
			"Cotes" will contain:
			 - a dateEmprunt in case the cote is borrowed
			 - a user property, referencing the user detaining the document
			 - a reserved property (which should have a date attached but will not in the case of this exercise)

			each document has a list of "cotes", each cote has a library (therefore each library has a list of cotes instead of a list of documents)

		* create user.reserved property, same as borrowed, can only be accessed by its user. contains reference to the user reserving.

MOBILE:
 - keep it simple. basicly a simpler version of web features.
 results are larger (cf google results), filters is a togglabe sidenav of the page. everything is way more vertical.

 menu will include Home, Login/logout/account, exit.
 Home will include links to library info pages.
 and thats pretty much it. 

 JAVA CLIENT:
	- remove card reader feature (no time!)
